# Mercado Forecasting
Time Series Analysis

## Summary

This project focuses on learning if there are any trends in hourly and seasonal web searches relating to Mercado, a large online retailer from South America.  
By analyzing the data with different slices of time, the hope is to gather information and be able to take advantage of these trends.  
This also uses Meta's (formerly Facebook) time series analysis tool, Prophet.  
Because of this, the code is written to be usable in Google Colab, as Prophet can be very intensive to run on local machines.  
Therefore, there are lines of code that were specially written for usablitity in Google Colab, specifically the visualizations through Bokeh.
